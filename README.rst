Releases
--------

The latest release is Grappelli 2.3.5 (11/10/2011), which requires Django 1.3.

This is a fork merging Fetzig's branch (https://github.com/fetzig/django-grappelli) for making Grappelli compatible with Django 1.4.
It's still compatible with Django 1.3 as long as you don't redefine ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX.
